From [My First Live Coding Interview](https://maya.rbind.io/posts/live-coding-interview/), by [Maya Gans](https://maya.rbind.io/):

::: {.body-text-s}
>***Intro:** "Yesterday I interviewed for a position maintaining and creating ShinyApps. To call that a JOB is crazy to me. I love developing reactive web applications, the fact that you can get paid to do that is still mind blowing. I’m realizing that having fun at work is actually a possibility!*
>
>*That said, the data scientist position usually includes a live coding portion. I went into it trying to treat my first one as practice, but every second I didn’t spend typing spanned an eternity. It was horrifying… but thinking about how to solve these questions was also kind of really fun?*
>
>*I’m fairly certain I won’t get the job. But I’m also certain it was an experience to learn and grow. The interview was so intense that it was pretty easy to recall the questions almost verbatim. I wanted to explore the questions again on my own with no pressure. And I’d love input on how to answer these more elegantly!"*
>
>***Conclusion:** "I left the interview feeling exhausted and deflated. I found myself asking: if I can’t answer these questions, what am I doing trying to become a data scientist? But now that I’ve spent a day to reflect, the interview was an incredible learning experience. It pinpointed concrete areas where I can grow and I honestly had fun thinking about these problems. I’m not sure I’ll ever perform smoothly under pressure, but at the very least I now have a function to separate duplicates from unique values!"*

::: {.body-text-s}

>
>*[Miles McBain](https://fosstodon.org/@milesmcbain)*
>
>*[Adam Sparks](https://rstats.me/@adamhsparks)*

>*The idea to livestream a R package review came from Nick Tierney. Others favorited, boosted, and commented on the Mastodon post, including myself. I’ve been working on this {soils} R package and am in the review/revise period of package development. Before I could get second thoughts, I volunteered this package for review. I was quite nervous about putting my work out there for critique, but I’m so happy that I did. And so grateful that Nick, Miles, and Adam all shared their brilliance! 🧠😇*
>
>*I’ve re-watched the session a few times to soak up all the gold nuggets of good practices, tips and tricks, and overall understanding of the package review process. Below, I’ve included the recording of the session, bullet point summaries of what I learned, what I did well, and what I can improve, and then my unpolished and mostly disorganized notes."*

Freytag's Pyramid

[**A common approach:**]{.body-text-m}

- storytelling / scene-setting in the intro (and maybe conclusion)
- technical instruction / tutorial-style writing in the body


Here are a few exampes: 



. . . 

Of course, there's no one *right* way to blog (or storytell for that matter) -- don't let this constrain you!

- how the author used a story to engage the reader (or not -- not every blog post will use a storytelling approach)
  - If there is a clear story line, where does it actually take place within the blog post?
- any other aspects that did or did not resonate with you

[**On your own, begin brainstorming *your* story. Consider:**]{.body-text-m}

- 
- what inspired you to blog about your chosen topic? 
- how does your chosen topic relate to your personal and professional interests? 
- was there a specific incident or catalyst that inspired your curiosity around this topic?
- what is the tension?
- what are your short and long-term learning goals and how does this topic fit within them?
- recall the key messages your wrote in your branding guide -- can you tell a story that helps to support those key messages?
- who will be reading this blog post (remember your target audience!)?

```{r}
countdown::countdown(
  minutes = 10,
  # right = 0,
  # Fanfare when it's over
  play_sound = TRUE,
  color_border              = "#FFFFFF",
  color_text                = "#7aa81e",
  color_running_background  = "#7aa81e",
  color_running_text        = "#FFFFFF",
  color_finished_background = "#ffa07a",
  color_finished_text       = "#FFFFFF",
  font_size = "2em",
  )
```

- what is the source of tension? (e.g. I thought I had figured out how to solve my data science problem, but package/function/approach X actually didn't quite do what I needed. I had to explore alternatives, and after a lot of trial and error, I landed on approach Y. Let me tell you )

## {#look-at-posts data-menu-title="Look at some posts"} 

[Writing (in any form) can feel intimidating . . .]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

The best way to get a sense of what data science blog posts *can* be like is (IMHO) to read some yourself. 

With your partner, choose and read / skim one of the following blog posts: 

- [1974...bird attacks?](https://allisonhorst.github.io/posts/2022-10-14-bird-attacks/), by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io/)
- [My first live coding interview](https://maya.rbind.io/posts/live-coding-interview/), by [Maya Gans](https://maya.rbind.io/)
- [Four ways to streamline your R workflows](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/four-ways-streamline-r-workflows/), by [Nicola Rennie](https://nrennie.rbind.io/)
- [Porting the Openscapes website from blogdown to Quarto](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2023-08-01-openscapes-website/), by [Sam Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/)

We'll read just a few short snippets from a handful of data science blogs to see:

- the breadth of topics folks write about
- different writing styles, including tone
- imagery and media you might include
- create approaches

---


---

YOUR TURN

- discuss with your partner your topic of choice and how it fits with your intended brand image; it can help to pull up your personal branding guide, for reference

You're allowed to bend or break the rules!

It can be difficult to balance story telling and technical tutorials (or times throughout MEDS where you'll be asked to turn your course projects into blog posts), but consider creative ways to engage your readers. 

Oftentimes, you'll see data science bloggers tell their story in the intro and (sometimes also) concluding paragraphs of their post (and leave the body of the post for all the technical bits): 

- https://maya.rbind.io/posts/live-coding-interview/ 
- https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/2020-08-03-last-change/ 
- https://thetidytrekker.com/post/making-circular-maps/making-circular-maps 
- https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2021-09-21-distill-blogs/

Pick one of blog post examples below and discuss with your partner what aspects of the story engaged you as a reader. What other elements (tone, humor, metaphors, hooks, etc.) resonated with you?

---

- have them read 2 posts in class and highlight what they do or don't like about them in class; can think about tone, framing, humor, illustrations/visuals (what did they add/subtract); writing is subjective!
- have a draft outline of a blog post; by end of course, there should a fully finished blog; can amplify on social media

---

- storytelling -- core pieces + embellishments (e.g. humor;j should add some but don't have to add all of them)
- rescue was usign a super frustrating fxn but then found a new bettter one!
- can break the rules; should have a story but not all of it has to be a part of the story necessarily
- read some curated SECTIONS of blog posts and discuss things like tone, audience, humor, visuals (things they liked/didnt like as both a reader and a writer
- draft an outline of their blog post in class and maybe exchange with someone for thoughts

## Other tips

If a long post, consider including a TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

## Other tips

include media! screenshots, outputs, code, gifs, etc.

one example: https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2023-08-01-openscapes-website/

--- 

some final takeaways: 

- i think it's okay to sometimes use your blog as a stream-of-consiousness brain dump of ideas / examples for yourself, but giving some thought to your post's structure, story, tone, and theme can serve your brand (credibility/trustworthy)

Potential tip: assign these style posts a category (e.g. quick-thoughts, raw-reflections, code-bites, short-takes; thanks ChatGPT for these suggestions)
