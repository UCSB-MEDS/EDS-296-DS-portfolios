>
>*That said, the data scientist position usually includes a live coding portion. I went into it trying to treat my first one as practice, but every second I didn’t spend typing spanned an eternity. It was horrifying… but thinking about how to solve these questions was also kind of really fun?*
>
>*I’m fairly certain I won’t get the job. But I’m also certain it was an experience to learn and grow. The interview was so intense that it was pretty easy to recall the questions almost verbatim. I wanted to explore the questions again on my own with no pressure. And I’d love input on how to answer these more elegantly!"*
>
>***Conclusion:** "I left the interview feeling exhausted and deflated. I found myself asking: if I can’t answer these questions, what am I doing trying to become a data scientist? But now that I’ve spent a day to reflect, the interview was an incredible learning experience. It pinpointed concrete areas where I can grow and I honestly had fun thinking about these problems. I’m not sure I’ll ever perform smoothly under pressure, but at the very least I now have a function to separate duplicates from unique values!"*

<hr>

<br>

[**On your own, begin brainstorming *your* story. Consider:**]{.body-text-m}

- what motivated / inspired you to blog about your chosen topic (e.g. was there a specific incident or catalyst)?
- is there a source of tension (e.g. overcoming a technical or learning challenge)?
- how does your chosen topic relate to your personal and / or professional interests? 
- what are your short and long-term learning goals and how does this topic fit within them?
- recall the key messages your wrote in your branding guide -- can you tell a story that helps to support those key messages?
- who are you writing for (remember, you define your target audience(s) in your personal branding guide!)?

[Once your story framework is scaffolded, adding in one (or more) of the following embellishment types can help you engage your readers:]{.body-text-m}

[[Matt Dray](https://www.matt-dray.com/) and [Adriana De Palma](https://adrianadepalma.com/)'s blog, [rostrum.blog](https://www.rostrum.blog/) is one that often (always?) leverages embellishments to engage their readers. Examples from their post, **[Base slaps!](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2023-10-17-nhs-r-2023/)**, on the following slides.]{.body-text-m}

The following slide content is adapted from [Alex Phillips'](https://www.alexandraatleephillips.com/) [ESM 438](https://bren.ucsb.edu/courses/esm-438) course materials [(week 2 slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dxviUquj4xTNY5pzoGSL-pukWgqC_nPqM9jCemiRAuY/edit#slide=id.g20e7ef3cb4c_0_395), with the added example of [Base Slaps!](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2023-10-17-nhs-r-2023/).

## {#humor data-menu-title="Humor"} 

[{{< fa wand-sparkles title="a wand with sparkles" >}} 1. Humor]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

To start, the title (**Base slaps!**) is pretty punny {{< fa face-laugh-beam title="a laughing face with squinty eyes" >}} (spoiler, it's about base R):

```{r}

#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/base-slaps.png")

<br>

And ends with this final closing paragraph:

::: {.body-text-s}
>*"But ultimately, I just wanted to do this terrible ‘base slaps’/‘slap bass’ pun, sorry. But also, I hear that zoomers say ‘slaps’ to mean ‘cool’. I think. Oh dear, this was a flimsy premise for a talk. Cringe-driven development?"*

<hr>

Use metaphors to improve connections or visualizations for your audience. And because blog posts are a versatile medium, don't shy away from including media that helps to demonstrate examples (and importantly, gives your readers a break from a wall of text and code).

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
>*"Re stability, vanilla R has changed little over time. Code written a couple of decades ago has a high chance of running now and will (likely) be executable for a long time into the future6. As a result, I contend that R is a horseshoe crab (unchanged for aeons, cryptically beautiful)."*

<br>

- do you like reading humor? do you like writing with humor? what might that look like for you (if you do choose to use humor)?
- how can you or your partner "hook" readers at the start of your blog posts? or elsewhere in the writing?
- what metaphors might you consider using and how do they help improve understanding of complex topics?

[{{< fa plus title="a plus sign" >}} Include a TL;DR, especially for long posts]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

[TL;DR - internet slang for Too Long; Didn't Read]{.body-text-m}

Should be a **short and succinct** summary of your main discussion points. It *should not* introduce new / additional information.

## {#headers data-menu-title="Headers"} 

[{{< fa plus title="a plus sign" >}} Use headers to help readers navigate content]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

Most visitors won't read your entire blog post, but rather want to jump to the parts that are relevant for them -- help them easily navigate by creating clear section headers (e.g. `#` - `####`) and enabling a [table of contents](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html#table-of-contents).

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("images/toc.png")
```

<br>

::: {.footer}
Set `toc: true` in either your `_quarto.yml` file (which would make this the default behavior across *all* your website pages), or in your blog post's YAML (which turns on table of contents for *just* that page). You may also adjust the `toc-depth` (number of section levels to include; defaults to 3).

## {#chunk-options data-menu-title="Chunk options"} 

[{{< fa plus title="a plus sign" >}} Set the appropriate code chunk options]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

Your data science blog posts will often include example code. Thoughtfully set your code chunk options so that your examples are easy to follow, but don't bog down your post by requiring readers to scroll past loonnngggg data frames or messages / warnings (unless there's an important and demonstrative reason to do so). Consider:

<br>

- do you need to show messages / warnings to demonstrate your point? if not, suppress them (`message: false` & `warning: false`)
- do you need to show the output of your code or *just* the code? (`eval: false` & `echo: true`)
- do you need to show the code or *just* the output? (`eval: true` & `echo: true`; defaults)

---

## {#consider-code data-menu-title="Consider code"} 

[{{< fa plus title="a plus sign" >}} Consider how you write / display your code]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

- use logical variable / object names
- include clear, succinct, and nicely structured code annotations, as appropriate (check out the [`{ARTofR}` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ARTofR/index.html))
- consider [*folding* code](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#folding-code) so that readers can expand / collapse code as needed (set `code-fold: true` in your post's YAML, or on a chunk-by-chunk basis)

## {#categories data-menu-title="Categories"}

<br>

[We learned last week how to add [category](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#categories) tags to individual blog posts. Use these strategically to group related posts. Some ideas / examples:]{.body-text-m}

<br>

- [**MEDS-related posts (e.g. course projects):**]{.teal-text} MEDS-project, grad-school
- [**Short / unpolished posts:**]{.teal-text} quick-thoughts, raw-reflections, code-bites, short-takes (thanks ChatGPT for these suggestions)
- [**Posts that use a particular language:**]{.teal-text} R, Python, JavaScript
- [**Domain-specific categories:**]{.teal-text} data-viz, machine-learning, GIS, databases, statistics, environmental-modeling

## {#media data-menu-title="Embed media"} 

[{{< fa plus title="a plus sign" >}} Embed media]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

There are a few ways to embed media (screenshots, screen recordings, gifs, images, etc.):

<br>

**In a code chunk using `{knitr}` (great when you're using R):**

```{{r}}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: "center" # or right, left
#| fig-cap: "Caption goes here"
#| fig-alt: "Alt text goes here"
knitr::include_graphics("file/path/to/image/file")
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Using markdown syntax:**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
![Caption goes here](file/path/to/image/file){width="100%" fig-alt="Alt text goes here"} # no alignment options using markdown; need to use HTML :(
```
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

**Using HTML syntax:**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
<img src="file/path/to/image/file" width="100%" alt="Alt text goes here"> # see https://gist.github.com/DavidWells/7d2e0e1bc78f4ac59a123ddf8b74932d for info on how to align images; see https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figcaption.asp when you want to add a figure caption
```
:::

::::

::: {.footer}
**Note:** I prefer using CSS for styling and aligning my figure captions. See [this example image caption](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io/blob/main/posts/2024-04-02-data-viz-course/index.qmd#L72) and the associated CSS rules ([1](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io/blob/061b2e1986f718307b56ca16017af74eab2f8730/styles.scss#L134) & [2](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io/blob/061b2e1986f718307b56ca16017af74eab2f8730/styles.scss#L118)).
