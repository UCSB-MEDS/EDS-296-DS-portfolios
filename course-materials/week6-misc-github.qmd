## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-class Prep {#pre-class-prep}

Please be sure to complete the following before class:

### A. Prepare to share your personal brand

You all have put a ton of work into developing your personal brand over the past six weeks, and we can learn a lot from one another by exploring the various elements that comprise our brands (e.g. adjectives, palettes, fonts, messaging, etc.). We'll wrap up the second half of class with a quick share out of each of our personal brands.

[**Prepare [a slide that showcases your personal brand](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/161jFMfXe6nom0EECl8rf4vep2uXvKpBU6SsVbTnMUL4/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"} ahead of class and be sure to include the following:**]{.teal-text}

- your headshot / landing page photo + at least one additional image asset
- your personal branding adjectives
- your target audience(s)
- your color palette and typefaces
- (optional) your logo and favicon
- the link to your personal website (so your peers can find you {{< fa face-smile-beam title="a smiling face with squinty eyes" >}})

[**You should also be prepared to share a 2-3 sentence overview of how you see your personal brand and how you're executing on it.**]{.teal-text}

- my brand overview:

>*"I want my brand to reflect my enthusiasm for data science education and inclusive pedagogical approaches, as well as my active participation in co-learning communities. The content I include focuses on data science tutorials and reflections around workflows, collaboration, and pedagogy. My mental and physical health benefits from active time outdoors -- my color palette (greens and warm highlights) is inspired by some of my favorite natural spaces that I recreate in, and reflects a calming / welcoming tone."*

We'll begin class with an overview of some of GitHub's many tools for organizing, collaborating, and managing data science / software projects, then wrap up with a share out of snippets from each of your portfolios:

## {{< fa plus title="plus" >}} What should I continue working on? {#continue-working}

1. [**Continue creating organized / polished GitHub repositories:**]{.teal-text} Consider this a part of your standard data science workflow from here on out. Your repos should be easy for someone else to navigate and understand using your README (and possibly other documentation, e.g. wiki).
2. [**Iterate on, and *importantly*, maintain your personal website:**]{.teal-text} Your website establishes your personal brand and acts as your centralized portfolio. Now that it's out in the world, it's important that you maintain it! It should accurately reflect you and your work -- return to it regularly to add new projects and content, and be sure to update text / content as necessary.   
3. [**Link to your personal website on your resume / cv:**]{.teal-text} Add your website URL to your resume (somewhere in your header typically makes the most sense).
4. [**Link to your polished GitHub repositories on your resume / cv, too!:**]{.teal-text} You may decide to highlight course and / or capstone projects, personal projects, etc. on your resume -- this is an awesome opportunity to link directly to your associated GitHub repository as well. ***Ensure that these repos are well-organized and documented.***
