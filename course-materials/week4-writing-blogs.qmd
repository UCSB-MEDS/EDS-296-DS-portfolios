## {{< fa box-open title="an open box" >}} Anticipated deliverable(s) {#anticipated-deliverables}

By the end of today's class, you should have:

- a draft of your first data science blog post

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-class Prep {#pre-class-prep}

Please be sure to complete the following before class:

### A. Add potential blog post topics / ideas to your personal branding guide (part VII)

Coming up with topics to blog about can feel intimidating (especially in the beginning), however your personal branding guide can help to steer you in a productive direction. Recall that your personal brand shapes how you present yourself, not only in your aesthetic choices, but also the types of content you choose to publish and the tone you use throughout. 

A few data science bloggers who have a recognizable brand: 

- **[Cédric Scherer's blog](https://www.cedricscherer.com/)** is one of the first places I turn to when I'm looking for **data viz / `{ggplot2}` content**
- **[Crystal Lewis' blog](https://cghlewis.com/blog/)** features lots of tutorials and conversations about **data management practices**
- **[Danielle Navarro's blog](https://blog.djnavarro.net/)** largely chronicles her experiences **learning new tools** and **creating generative art**

**NOTE:** You (most likely) will not have your brand identity fully sorted and solidified by this point (and that's perfectly okay!). The above examples are meant to show how working towards finding your brand can (over time) help build a pattern of trust that draws visitors back to your website in search of familiar content.

[**Review your personal branding guide and jot down some potential blog post ideas / topics that fit your brand identity (part VII; refer back to the [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_GDgYPRR5hZzodwXyJV2aBWKU_OTBY3JOwi0dlSyBAQ/edit){target="_blank"}, if necessary). Be prepared to select *one* of your ideas during class, where you'll begin to actually draft your first blog post. Consider the following:**]{.teal-text}

- What do your personal branding adjectives and key messages say about you and your interests? 
- What topics blend your current interests and expertise with your future learning goals?
- What might draw someone to *your* website over a different website? Consider how your brand can help to define your niche.
- Not all data science blog posts need to be technical (e.g. include example code) -- reflections and commentary on different aspects of your data science journey can be equally as valuable.
- Ultimately, you should be choosing something you're excited to write about (it can be easier to engage a reader when you yourself are jazzed about the topic)!

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
## Need some help kickstarting the creatvity? Here are some potential blog post topics / ideas to consider:

- how your past professional or personal interests led you to pursue a degree in environmental data science
- non-data science skills / experiences that you've found to be transferable to your data science learning journey (in perhaps surprising / unexpected ways) 
- advice you wish you had before beginning a data science program
- reflecting on the MEDS 6-week summer coding bootcamp
- your journey towards discovering your personal brand identity / building your website(!)
- what early data science skills you've found most valuable or surprising (so far), and why
- a mini tutorial on a focused data science skill / topic, e.g. 
  - how to use a particularly helpful function(s)
  - a data science workflow or organizational procedure you've adopted, and why
  - building a data visualization or other creative product

It's still valuable (and important) to think about how your framing, tone, and focus within each of these suggested topic areas fits your brand identity.

### B. (Optional) Check out some data science-y blog posts

Reading other data science blogs is the best way to get a sense of not only the breadth of topics that folks in the community are writing about, but also the tone, writing styles, and creative approaches you might take as a blogger. We'll discuss some snippets from example blog posts during class, though you should feel free to explore some blogs ahead of time, if you're eager:

## A small collection of data science posts and blogs:

A handful of posts to showcase some different writing styles and topics areas:

## {{< fa plus title="plus" >}} What should I continue working on? {#continue-working}

1. [**Seek feedback on your draft / plan from others.**]{.teal-text} Consider switching blog post drafts with one (or more) of your peers, or stick around for office hours to chat with me about your ideas!
2. [**Continue drafting, writing, and polishing your blog post.**]{.teal-text} You (most likely) won't have a fully-written blog post by the end of class today, but ***you should plan to complete and publish your post by the end of this class.***
