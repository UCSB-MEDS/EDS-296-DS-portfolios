## {{< fa box-open title="an open box" >}} Anticipated deliverable(s) {#anticipated-deliverables}

By the end of today's class, you should have:

- a polished and informative README added to one (or more) of your past MEDS homework assignment repositories
- a GitHub *profile* README to welcome visitors and showcase your interests / work 

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-class Prep {#pre-class-prep}

### A. Choose a GitHub repo

- TODO: choose a repo from past hw assignments (TODO: get links to assignments from Carmen, Ruth, Max, etc.)

### B. Draft up text to add to your GitHub profile README

A GitHub *profile* README is a special README that is displayed on your profile's landing page (e.g. see [mine](https://github.com/samanthacsik){target="_blank"}). A well-crafted profile README not only welcomes visitors to your page, but can also help you stand out to potential collaborators or employers. 

Consider what content you might want to include in *your* GitHub profile README. Take a look at a few examples, below, for inspiration, then draft up some text / images / etc. in a Google Doc (or other easily accessible location) to refer to during class.
