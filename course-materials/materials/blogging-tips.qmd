>
>*That said, the data scientist position usually includes a live coding portion. I went into it trying to treat my first one as practice, but every second I didn’t spend typing spanned an eternity. It was horrifying… but thinking about how to solve these questions was also kind of really fun?*
>
>*I’m fairly certain I won’t get the job. But I’m also certain it was an experience to learn and grow. The interview was so intense that it was pretty easy to recall the questions almost verbatim. I wanted to explore the questions again on my own with no pressure. And I’d love input on how to answer these more elegantly!"*
>
>***Conclusion:** "I left the interview feeling exhausted and deflated. I found myself asking: if I can’t answer these questions, what am I doing trying to become a data scientist? But now that I’ve spent a day to reflect, the interview was an incredible learning experience. It pinpointed concrete areas where I can grow and I honestly had fun thinking about these problems. I’m not sure I’ll ever perform smoothly under pressure, but at the very least I now have a function to separate duplicates from unique values!"*

[{{< fa book-open title="an open book" >}} YOUR TURN - brainstorm]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

<br>

[**On your own, begin brainstorming *your* story. Consider:**]{.body-text-m}

- what motivated / inspired you to blog about your chosen topic (e.g. was there a specific incident or catalyst)?
- is there a source of tension (e.g. overcoming a technical or learning challenge)?
- how does your chosen topic relate to your personal and professional interests? 
- what are your short and long-term learning goals and how does this topic fit within them?
- recall the key messages your wrote in your branding guide -- can you tell a story that helps to support those key messages?
- who are you writing for (remember, you define your target audience(s) in your personal branding guide!)?

```{r}
countdown::countdown(
  minutes = 6,
  # right = 0,
  # Fanfare when it's over
  play_sound = TRUE,
  color_border              = "#FFFFFF",
  color_text                = "#7aa81e",
  color_running_background  = "#7aa81e",
  color_running_text        = "#FFFFFF",
  color_finished_background = "#ffa07a",
  color_finished_text       = "#FFFFFF",
  font_size = "2em",
  )
```

::: {.notes}
(e.g. I thought I had figured out how to solve my data science problem, but package/function/approach X actually didn't quite do what I needed. I had to explore alternatives, and after a lot of trial and error, I landed on approach Y. Let me tell you about my solution...)

## {#tldr data-menu-title="TL;DR"} 

[{{< fa plus title="a plus sign" >}} Include a TL;DR, especially for long posts]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

[TL;DR - internet slang for Too Long; Didn't Read]{.body-text-m}

Should be a **short and succinct** summary of your main discussion points. It *should not* introduce new / additional information. 

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("images/tldr.png")

::: {.footer}
H/T: [Julie Lowndes](https://openscapes.org/team) for recommending using TL;DRs in blog posts! I gave it a shot for the first time in my post, [Porting the Openscapes website from blogdown to Quarto](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2023-08-01-openscapes-website/).

## {#headers data-menu-title="Headers"} 

[{{< fa plus title="a plus sign" >}} Use headers to help readers navigate]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

use appropriate headers and include TOC so readers can quickly jump from section to section

---

## {#chunk-options data-menu-title="Chunk options"} 

[{{< fa plus title="a plus sign" >}} Set the appropriate code chunk options]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

set the appropriate code chunk options (e.g. warning: false / message: false to prevent long text to bog down your blog)

- don't print out looonngggg data frames or warnings / messages (unless there's an important and demonstrative reason to do so)
- include only the necessary code and make it clear (logical variable / object names, annotations as appropriate)  

--- 

## {#categories data-menu-title="Categories"} 

[{{< fa plus title="a plus sign" >}} Strategically assign categories]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

some final takeaways: 

- i think it's okay to sometimes use your blog as a stream-of-consiousness brain dump of ideas / examples for yourself, but giving some thought to your post's structure, story, tone, and theme can serve your brand (credibility/trustworthy)

Potential tip: assign these style posts a category (e.g. quick-thoughts, raw-reflections, code-bites, short-takes; thanks ChatGPT for these suggestions)
