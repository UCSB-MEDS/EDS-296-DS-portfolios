GitHub provides *many* cool project management features that facilitate organization, collaboration, coding, and building workflows. By using these tools (while working solo *and* while working with others), you can demonstrate your technical and programming proficiencies.

[***Issues are a useful and valuable tool for tracking TODOs, jotting down ideas, recording bugs, etc., regardless of whether you're working alone or with collaborators.***]{.body-text-m}

<br>

. . . 

Like most things, it's great to **put some care and thought into writing an issue** (*especially* when collaborating or contributing thoughts to a public project e.g. [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues)). . .

<br>

. . . 

. . . *but* I'd also argue that **a hasty issue on a personal project can still go a long way** in helping you remember a helpful resource, or that idea that popped into your mind at a time you couldn't devote much attention to it.

[**From GitHub Docs:**]{.body-text-m}

>GitHub Actions (GHA) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.

<br>

[**You can use GHA to automate *pretty much anything* (truly)! But some concrete examples:**]{.body-text-m}

::: {.incremental}
- building and deploying a GitHub Pages site whenever changes are pushed or merged into `main` (what we'll be doing today)
- adding appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repo
- runing tests whenever code is pushed to a repo to ensure new changes don't break existing code
- running data analysis pipelines whenever new data is pushed to the repo
- running linters to ensure code adheres to a particular style guide

- **job:** a set of steps in a *workflow* that is executed on the same *runner;* steps are executed in order (e.g. check out repo, install Quarto, install R + dependencies, render & publish Quarto project)

## {#templates data-menu-title="Workflow templates"}

[Get started with a workflow template]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

Rather than starting from a blank slate, you can **use as-is *or* adapt pre-made [workflow templates](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/using-workflow-templates)** to create your desired GitHub Actions workflow.

. . . 

<br>

The next few slides walk through setting up a *GitHub Action you can use to automate the building and deployment of your Quarto website. We'll use a [workflow template](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#example-knitr-with-renv) provided in the Quarto documentation.

. . .

<br>

**We'll follow these general steps:** 

1. Set up a virtual environment for our project
2. Create a `gh-pages` branch, where our rendered website files will be stored
3. Add a GHA workflow to our repository
4. Reconfigure GitHub Pages to serve our website from our `gh-pages` branch

::: {.footer}
**IMPORTANT:** The following instructions assume you've only included R code in your Quarto website. If you have content (e.g. blog posts) that include Python code, you'll need to modify our chosen workflow.

need to use [`{renv}` package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/#:~:text=Use%20renv%3A%3Ainit(),recorded%20into%20a%20lockfile%2C%20renv.)

>Use `renv::init()` to initialize renv in a new or existing project. This will set up a project library, containing all the packages you’re currently using. The packages (and all the metadata needed to reinstall them) are recorded into a lockfile, renv.lock, and a .Rprofile ensures that the library is used every time you open that project.
>
>As you continue to work on your project, you will install and upgrade packages, either using install.packages() and update.packages or renv::install() and renv::update(). After you’ve confirmed your code works as expected, use renv::snapshot() to record the packages and their sources in the lockfile.
>
>Later, if you need to share your code with someone else or run your code on new machine, your collaborator (or you) can call renv::restore() to reinstall the specific package versions recorded in the lockfile.

---

- install `{renv}`
- run `renv::init()`
- say Y when it asks if you want to proceed
- install `{yaml}` if prompted (`Warning: The 'yaml' package is required to parse dependencies within Quarto Markdown files`)

- go to github repo
- click on branch dropdown > View all branches > New Branch > in the New branch name field, type `gh-pages` > click Create new branch

- return to RStudio
- using Terminal or New folder button, add a folder named `.github` in your root directory
- inside `.github/` create another folder called `workflows`
- inside `workflows/` add a file (using Terminal or New File > Text file) named `publish.yml`
- copy content from https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#example-knitr-with-renv into `publish.yml`
- remove line in `_quarto.yml` (`output-dir: docs`)
- delete `docs/` folder
- add commit push to github

- return to github
- (you will probably get an email saying [yourUserName/yourSiteName] pages build and deployment workflow run)
- go to Settings > Pages > switch branch from `main` to `gh-pages` and from `/docs` to `/(root)` > click Save > check out Actions tab while your site redeploys
