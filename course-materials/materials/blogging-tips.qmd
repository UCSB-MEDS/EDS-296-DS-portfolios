## {#look-at-posts data-menu-title="Look at some posts"} 

[Writing (in any form) can feel intimidating . . .]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

The best way to get a sense of what data science blog posts *can* be like is (IMHO) to read some yourself. 

With your partner, choose and read / skim one of the following blog posts: 

- [1974...bird attacks?](https://allisonhorst.github.io/posts/2022-10-14-bird-attacks/), by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io/)
- [My first live coding interview](https://maya.rbind.io/posts/live-coding-interview/), by [Maya Gans](https://maya.rbind.io/)
- [Four ways to streamline your R workflows](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/four-ways-streamline-r-workflows/), by [Nicola Rennie](https://nrennie.rbind.io/)
- [Porting the Openscapes website from blogdown to Quarto](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2023-08-01-openscapes-website/), by [Sam Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/)

We'll read just a few short snippets from a handful of data science blogs to see:

- the breadth of topics folks write about
- different writing styles, including tone
- imagery and media you might include
- create approaches

---


---

YOUR TURN

- discuss with your partner your topic of choice and how it fits with your intended brand image; it can help to pull up your personal branding guide for reference

[add timer]


---

You're allowed to bend or break the rules!

It can be difficult to balance story telling and technical tutorials (or times throughout MEDS where you'll be asked to turn your course projects into blog posts), but consider creative ways to engage your readers. 

Oftentimes, you'll see data science bloggers tell their story in the intro and (sometimes also) concluding paragraphs of their post (and leave the body of the post for all the technical bits): 

- https://maya.rbind.io/posts/live-coding-interview/ 
- https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/2020-08-03-last-change/ 
- https://thetidytrekker.com/post/making-circular-maps/making-circular-maps 
- https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2021-09-21-distill-blogs/

Pick one of blog post examples below and discuss with your partner what aspects of the story engaged you as a reader. What other elements (tone, humor, metaphors, hooks, etc.) resonated with you?

---

- have them read 2 posts in class and highlight what they do or don't like about them in class; can think about tone, framing, humor, illustrations/visuals (what did they add/subtract); writing is subjective!
- have a draft outline of a blog post; by end of course, there should a fully finished blog; can amplify on social media

---

- storytelling -- core pieces + embellishments (e.g. humor;j should add some but don't have to add all of them)
- rescue was usign a super frustrating fxn but then found a new bettter one!
- can break the rules; should have a story but not all of it has to be a part of the story necessarily
- read some curated SECTIONS of blog posts and discuss things like tone, audience, humor, visuals (things they liked/didnt like as both a reader and a writer
- draft an outline of their blog post in class and maybe exchange with someone for thoughts

---

## Other tips

If a long post, consider including a TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

HT: Julie Lowndes

---

## Other tips

include media! screenshots, outputs, code, gifs, etc.

one example: https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2023-08-01-openscapes-website/

--- 

some final takeaways: 

- i think it's okay to sometimes use your blog as a stream-of-consiousness brain dump of ideas / examples for yourself, but giving some thought to your post's structure, story, tone, and theme can serve your brand (credibility/trustworthy)

Potential tip: assign these style posts a category (e.g. quick-thoughts, raw-reflections, code-bites, short-takes; thanks ChatGPT for these suggestions)
