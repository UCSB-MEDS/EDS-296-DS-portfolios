## {#gh-accessibility data-menu-title="GH Accessibility"} 

[Improve your GitHub profile page accessibility]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

*A few simple ways to ensure that assistive technology can help users understand and navigate your README:*

1. **Make links descriptive:** assistive technologies present links in isolation, so provide context
    - e.g. opt for *"Find the [EDS 296-1F course description](https://bren.ucsb.edu/courses/eds-296-1f)..."* rather than *"Find the EDS 296-1F course description [here](https://bren.ucsb.edu/courses/eds-296-1f)"*

2. **Add alt text to images:** screen readers read alt text descriptions out loud
    - e.g. in html, `<img src="image-url.com" alt="This is alt text">`

3. **Use proper heading structure:** helps people understand content structure and more easily navigate sections
    - e.g. use `#` for your title, then the appropriate level-header thereafter (don't skip levels)

4. **Structure lists with proper markup:** helps people understand lists as they are intended
    - e.g. use `*` or `-` for each list item, rather than special characters or emojis
