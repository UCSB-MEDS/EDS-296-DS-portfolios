Her posit::conf(2024) talk, titled, GitHub: How To Tell Your Professional Story is an excellent primer for thinking about GitHub as a professional portfolio. I hope Posit will have this year’s talk recordings posted before this class, but just in case they don’t, you can watch my screen recorded version (you’ll need to use your @ucsb.edu account to access Google Drive).\n\n\nB.

Otherwise, you can choose any repository you feel could use some added documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nC. Draft up text to add to your GitHub profile README\nA GitHub profile README is a special README that is displayed on your profile’s landing page (e.g. see mine). A well-crafted profile README not only welcomes visitors to your page, but can also help you stand out to potential collaborators or employers. It’s helpful to include a short bio and highlight some current projects / interests.\nConsider what content you might want to include in your GitHub profile README (and remember to refer back to your branding guide!). Take a look at a few examples for inspiration, then draft up some text / images / etc. in a Google Doc (or other easily accessible location) to refer to during class (it’s okay if this is just a first pass – you can continue to iterate!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few example GitHub profile READMEs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllison Horst\nAlex Phillips\nSilvia Canelón\nCrystal Lewis\nAwesome GitHub Profile READMEs (a collection of great profile READMEs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD.

Gather materials to add to your website’s landing page\nDuring this session, you’ll have the opportunity to add some personal information to your website’s landing page. It’ll help to have an idea of what you might want to include (at least as a starting point – your website’s content will most certainly evolve over time). Consider the following before attending class:\n\nHave your professional headshot handy. Your Bren photo is a great option here! Save your photo to your Desktop (or somewhere you can easily find again) for now.\nConsider which landing page template to use. We’ll be applying one of Quarto’s five available built-in templates when we create our website’s landing page. Take a peek at the template previews and identify which one(s) you like most (e.g. I’m currently a fan of jolla, but used trestles for a long while). Consider how you’d like to arrange your personal bio / info given the layout of your top choice template.\nDraft your personal bio / blurb. Consider reusing parts of your Bren bio, or even drafting a shortened, catchy version of it for your landing page (and make note of the tips, below!). Save your text in a place you can quickly copy from during class (e.g. a Google Doc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome considerations and example website bios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust your bio to fit your chosen landing page template. For example, jolla works well with short bios or even taglines, while trestles might be a better choice if you’re looking to add longer and / or multiple sections.    \nCheck out a few example websites for bio inspiration. Here are just a small handful fo websites, each with a slightly different approach to their landing page bios:\n\nSamantha Csik (yours truly)\nNick Lyon (NCEAS Data Analyst)\nDaphne Virlar-Knight (MESM 2020)\nRay Hunter (MESM 2024)\nSam Muir (MEDS 2024)\nMelissa Widas (MEDS 2024)\nVictoria Cutler (MEDS 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGather your important public profile links. Your personal website is an excellent place to link out to your other public profiles in one, organized place. Bookmark / save the links you’d like to include (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, even your preferred email address)"

But some concrete examples:\n\n\nbuilding and deploying a GitHub Pages site whenever changes are pushed or merged into main\nadding appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repo\nrunning tests whenever code is pushed to a repo to ensure new changes don’t break existing code\nrunning data analysis pipelines whenever new data is pushed to the repo\nrunning linters to ensure code adheres to a particular style guide\n\n\n\n1Continuous integration is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. 2Continuous deployment is the practice of using automation to publish and deploy software updates.

As data scientists, this often means that they’ll head to one of two places: GitHub and / or your personal website. This course is designed to help you both lay the foundation for creating and maintaining these profiles in an organized, informative, and visually-appealing way. Over the next several weeks, you will:\n\nbegin developing your personal brand\nbuild and deploy your personal website using popular data science tools and frameworks\ncreate your first (of many!) data science blog posts\nlearn about how best to communicate your work to different audiences\nunderstand where and how to document your projects and code on GitHub\nand more!\n\nThroughout the MEDS program, you’ll be asked to turn assignments and projects into science communication pieces on your personal websites blog. These are excellent opportunities to build out your portfolio ahead of your job search."

    "text": "ANOTHER EXAMPLE: Maya Gans\n\nFrom My First Live Coding Interview, by Maya Gans:\n\n\nIntro: “Yesterday I interviewed for a position maintaining and creating ShinyApps. To call that a JOB is crazy to me. I love developing reactive web applications, the fact that you can get paid to do that is still mind blowing. I’m realizing that having fun at work is actually a possibility!\nThat said, the data scientist position usually includes a live coding portion. I went into it trying to treat my first one as practice, but every second I didn’t spend typing spanned an eternity. It was horrifying… but thinking about how to solve these questions was also kind of really fun?\nI’m fairly certain I won’t get the job. But I’m also certain it was an experience to learn and grow. The interview was so intense that it was pretty easy to recall the questions almost verbatim. I wanted to explore the questions again on my own with no pressure. And I’d love input on how to answer these more elegantly!“\nConclusion: “I left the interview feeling exhausted and deflated. I found myself asking: if I can’t answer these questions, what am I doing trying to become a data scientist? But now that I’ve spent a day to reflect, the interview was an incredible learning experience. It pinpointed concrete areas where I can grow and I honestly had fun thinking about these problems. I’m not sure I’ll ever perform smoothly under pressure, but at the very least I now have a function to separate duplicates from unique values!”\n\n\n\n\n\n−+\n02:00"

Add potential blog post topics / ideas to your personal branding guide (part VII)\nComing up with topics to blog about can feel intimidating (especially in the beginning), however your personal branding guide can help to steer you in a productive direction. Recall that your personal brand shapes how you present yourself, not only in your aesthetic choices, but also the types of content you choose to publish and the tone you use throughout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few data science bloggers who have a recognizable brand:\n\n\n\n\nCédric Scherer’s blog is one of the first places I turn to when I’m looking for data viz / {ggplot2} content\nCrystal Lewis’ blog features lots of tutorials and conversations about data management practices\nDanielle Navarro’s blog largely chronicles her experiences learning new tools and creating generative art\n\nNOTE: You (most likely) will not have your brand identity fully sorted and solidified by this point (and that’s perfectly okay!). The above examples are meant to show how working towards finding your brand can (over time) help build a pattern of trust that draws visitors back to your website in search of familiar content.\n\n\nReview your personal branding guide and jot down some (2-4, or more if you want!) potential blog post ideas / topics that fit your brand identity (part VII; refer back to the template, if necessary). Be prepared to select one of your ideas during class, where you’ll begin to actually draft your first blog post. Consider the following:\n\nWhat do your personal branding adjectives and key messages say about you and your interests?\nWhat topics blend your current interests and expertise with your future learning goals?\nWhat might draw someone to your website over a different website? Consider how your brand can help to define your niche.\nNot all data science blog posts need to be technical (e.g. include example code) – reflections and commentary on different aspects of your data science journey can be equally as valuable.\nUltimately, you should be choosing something you’re excited to write about (it can be easier to engage a reader when you yourself are jazzed about the topic)!\nImportant: Consider topics that you can feasibly write a blog post on by the end of this course (week 6) – you may also add larger-scoped or more involved topic ideas to your personal branding guide to return to in the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed some help kickstarting the creatvity?

(Optional) Check out some data science-y blog posts\nReading other data science blogs is the best way to get a sense of not only the breadth of topics that folks in the community are writing about, but also the tone, writing styles, and creative approaches you might take as a blogger. We’ll discuss some example blog posts during class, though you should feel free to explore ahead of time, if you’re eager:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA small collection of data science posts and blogs:\n\n\n\n\n\nA handful of posts to showcase some different writing styles and topics areas:\n\nAn introduction to Python for R Users, by Rebecca Barter\nMy first live coding interview, by Maya Gans\nNotes from live code review of {soils}, by Jadey Ryan\nCreating typewriter-styled maps in {ggplot2}, by Nicola Rennie\nPorting the Openscapes website from blogdown to Quarto, by Sam Csik\nGenerative art with grid, by Danielle Navarro\nSlidecrafting 101: Layout, by Emil Hvitfeldt\n\nAnd a few additional fun blogs to keep an eye on:\n\nMeghan Hall\nMeghan Harris\nCrystal Lewis\nCosima Meyer\nBeatriz Milz\nShannon Pileggi\nAlbert Rapp\nNicola Rennie\nCédric Scherer\nCara Thompson\nNick Tierney\nIsabella Velásquez\nrostrum.blog (by Matt Dray and Adriana De Palma)\n\nThis is only a small sampling of the many rad data science bloggers out there – if you stumble upon others that you enjoy, be sure to share them in the class Slack channel!"

Create your own personal branding guide\nThis week’s pre-class prep is to create your own personal branding guide – a collection of visual and messaging resources (e.g. colors, fonts, logos, key words) used to create a uniform image of a brand. Here, that brand is you!\nWhy is it important that you consider your brand identity? Bren Teaching Faculty and science communication professional, Alex Phillips, summarizes this nicely in her talk Establishing Your Online Presence. She explains that establishing your brand identity:\n\ngives you more control over your online presence \ncreates consistency, which builds trustworthiness and credibility \nfilters decision-making about your online content \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterested in reading more about the benefits of developing a personal brand? Check out these resources:\n\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Miya Scheble (MEDS career Development Program Manager) for sharing these resources!\n\nHow to build your personal brand as a newbie data analyst., by Bright\nBuilding a Personal Brand in Data Science: Your Key to Career Advancement, by Kannan Kasi\nUsing data science to build a personal brand, by Abigail (Abby) Shockley\nHow To Build a Personal Brand: 10 Tips, by Shayna Joubert\nHow to Build a Personal Brand Website: 5 Essentials to Include, by Kathryn Lang\nBuilding a Data Science Brand, by Kate Strachnyi\n\n\n\n\nFill out this personal branding guide template ahead of class. Read through sections I - VI, below, for guidance. Here is my personal branding guide, as an example.\n\nI. Write down your personal branding adjectives and key messages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Expand for information on branding adjectives and key messages\n\n\n\n\n\nYour personal branding adjectives are words that guide how you present yourself and your brand. While you don’t need to explicitly state these words on your website (though you certainly can!), they serve to:\n\ndefine your brand’s personality\nconnect with your target audience(s)\nshape your tone (in both your writing, visual, and overall aesthetic styles)\n\nWrite down 3-5 adjectives to describe your personal brand.\nConsider:\n\nHow do you want people to perceive you?\nWhat do you want to communicate about yourself?\nWhat are your qualities, motivations, values, strengths? Your personal branding adjectives do not need to describe everything you already are – they can be descriptors of your long-term goals, values, and motivations.\nYou can check out some curated lists as a starting point – see lists by Lead Through Strengths and Branding by Juls, or explore the many others online\n\nOnce you’ve determined your personal branding adjectives, jot down a few key messages that capture the core ideas you want to convey about your brand.\nConsider:\n\nHow do these key messages incorporate / add context to your personal branding adjectives?\nAim for ~2-3 sentences (can be bullet points)\nSimilar to your adjectives, these key messages do not need to be explicitly stated somewhere on your website. However, you may find that they work well as taglines on your landing page (or even your LinkedIn profile), or help you (re)frame your website bio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Define your target audience(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Expand for information on defining your target audience(s)\n\n\n\n\n\nYour brand does not need to speak to or reach everyone – instead, you should have a target audience(s) in mind. Knowing your audience helps you make decisions on:\n\nwhat types of content you publish\nhow you arrange content\nwhat level or types of details you need to include\nyour tone\n\nWrite down your target audience(s).\nSome examples include:\n\npotential employers (feel free to be more specific here as well, e.g. potential employers in the environmental data science sector)\nearly career data scientists or environmental scientists\nenvironmental data scientists who are also passionate about &lt; fill in the blank &gt; (Jadey Ryan is a great example of this!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. Select your typefaces / fonts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Expand for information on selecting typefaces / fonts\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, a few important definitions:\n\ntypeface (aka font family): the underlying visual design (e.g. Times New Roman, Helvetica, Roboto)\nfont: an implementation / variation of a typeface (e.g. Times New Roman in bold, Times New Roman in italic)\n\nDuring class, we’ll learn how to import font families from Google Fonts for use across our website. Explore the vast selection, and choose 1-2 font families. Add their names and hyperlinks to your personal branding guide.\n\nTips on choosing your font family(ies):\n\nStick to 1-2 font families. Using too many typefaces can overwhelm a reader. You can use one typeface across your entire website, or alternatively, choose one typeface for things like header text and another for body text.\nWhen in doubt, use a sans-serif font family. Sans-serif fonts work great everywhere, but are especially ideal for body text since they’re cleaner and easier to read. If you do want to use a serif font, it’s best to reserve those for any header text.\nMake sure your font family choice(s) have a variety of styles. If your font family doesn’t include bold or italicized styles, you won’t actually be able to apply those styles to your website. For example, Nunito comes in a variety of weights (boldness levels) and italic, where Sen comes in a variety of weights, but not italic.\nCheck out some visually-pleasing font pairings. fontpair has hundreds of Google Font pairings to browse!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. Build your color palette\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Expand for information on building color palettes\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most exciting parts of building a website is deciding on which colors you’ll use. This can take some time and tweaking, so it’s helpful to think a bit about your palette beforehand. We’ll consider updating colors for the following website elements:\n\nNavigation Bar: navbar background color, foreground (text) color, hover highlight color\nMain Body: body background color, body text color, hyperlink color, in-line code color, inline-code background color\nPage Footer: footer background color\n\nWe’ll be using a language called Sass to create variables for each of the colors we plan to use throughout our websites (more on that soon!).\nIt’s helpful to draft up your color variables ahead of time (and save them to your personal branding guide) so that you easily copy them into your stylesheet during class. Define your color variables using the syntax, $variable-name: value;, where you decide on your variable-name, and value is a HEX color code (htmlcolorcodes.com is my favorite site for grabbing HEX codes).\nFor example, here are the color variables I’ll use for my website during the workshop:\n\n$dark-green: #858E79;\n$light-green: #D1D9CE;\n$cream: #FDFBF7;\n$gray: #64605f;\n$purple: #9158A2;\n$orange: #ad7237;\n\n\nTips on choosing your color palette:\n\nStick to about 3-4 main colors. Choosing too many colors can overwhelm readers. Consider using different shades of the primary color throughout your site, with a couple complementing / contrasting colors for important highlighted text and / or features. A good general rule of thumb is the 60-30-10 rule – your primary color should be used in ~60% of your design, the secondary color should take up ~30%, and your accent color ~10%.\nConsider what emotions your color choices evoke: Colors influence perceptions, emotions, and even behavior. Consider which colors best reflect your branding adjectives and key messages. See this post on color psychology, by HubSpot for guidance.\nUse a random color generator. My favorite is https://coolors.co/ – press the space bar to generate new colors. When you see one (or more) that you like, “lock” them in place by clicking on the lock icon. Continue pressing the space bar to generate new colors in the “unlocked” positions.\nGenerate a color palette from a photo / image. Have an interesting background in your headshot? Consider generating a palette off of it! Check out Color Thief for all your color stealing needs. Alternatively, explore pre-made palettes generated from trending Adobe Stock photos.\nConsider contrast and colorblindness-friendly palettes. I love the Let’s get color blind Google Chrome extension for simulating color deficiencies in the web browser, and the coolers color contrast checker for calculating the contrast ratio of text and background colors (it’ll even suggest modified colors to improve your contrast, if needed).\nGet inspired by other websites. And you don’t need to take inspiration only from Quarto websites. Just a small handful of examples sites with color schemes that I really love:\n\nAngelina Miller\nMeghan Hall\nNicola Rennie\nSylvia Canelón\nEmil Hvitfeldt\nElla Kaye\nRobert Mitchell\nMaya Gans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV. (Optional) Create a personal logo and / or favicon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Expand for information on creating a personal logo\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto supports adding a personal logo to the top left corner of your website’s navbar (e.g. see my website). While completely optional, logos can be attention-grabbing and memorable, offering a way to distinguish yourself. If you’d like to start workshopping your own logo, consider the following tips and try out some free logo makers:\n\nTips & resources for creating a personal logo:\n\nKeep it simple\nConsider incorporating your name or initials (though not necessarily required)\nColors and fonts should match / complement the rest of your branding guide\nConsider creating a favicon (image displayed in a web browser’s address bar) that matches / complements your logo\nTry out one of these free logo makers:\n\nAdobe Express (this is what I used for my personal logo)\nCanva\nWix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVI. Curate potential image assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Expand for information on image assets\n\n\n\n\n\nBranding image assets are visual elements that help to define a brand’s identity.\nThese include your logo, headshot, and any other photos / images you plan to use across your website. You might also include images that influence the overall aesthetic of your brand, but that might not necessarily be used as content on your site.\nBegin gathering your image assets and add them to your personal branding guide."

    "section": " What should I continue working on?",
    "text": "What should I continue working on?\n\nSeek feedback on your personal brand from those who know you well. Would they use the same adjectives to describe you? What strengths and characteristics do they perceive that you hadn’t identified yourself? What emotions do your colors, fonts, imagery, and tone evoke? It’s important to remember that your personal brand can (and should) evolve with you! This week is just a starting point.\nRevisit and revise your landing page content / bio, as needed. Does your landing page bio fit your personal brand? Consider what information you include and your tone – does it make sense to revise your bio to better fit your brand? Consider if your chosen template suits your needs, or if a different layout might work better.\nAdd pages to your website. Has thinking deeply about your personal brand inspired ideas for different web pages? Go ahead and add them! Recall that you can add / remove pages by modifying your _quarto.yml file (see last class’ materials if you need a reminder of how to do so). It’s sufficient to include placeholder text to those pages (e.g. Coming soon!) if you’re not quite ready to complete them. You may also remove pages (e.g. about.qmd and resources.qmd) if you don’t plan to use them (though note that you must keep index.qmd).\nFinish applying your colors to different website elements using Quarto’s Sass variables. And test out different color combos and / or fonts, if you’re not totally satisfied with your original choices. This is arguably the most fun part of building your website and where you can really let your personality and brand shine through. It can take a while to settle on something that you feel really represents you, and that’s okay (I’ve changed my entire color scheme and font styles multiple times over the years).\nConsider writing / borrowing / adapting CSS rules to refine your website styling. You can take your website styling far just by defining Quarto’s Sass variables. However, if you’re looking to fine-tune the appearance of certain web page elements, you may consider turning to more CSS. Review the workshop slides for suggested approaches and tools for guiding your CSS-writing journeys."
