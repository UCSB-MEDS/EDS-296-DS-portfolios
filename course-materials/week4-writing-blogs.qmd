### A. Check out some data science-y blog posts

Reading other data science blogs is the best way to get a sense of not only the breadth of topics folks in the community are writing about, but also the tone, writing styles, and creative approaches you might take as a blogger. Check out a couple posts before class!

## A small collection of data science posts and blogs:

A handful of posts to showcase some different writing styles and topics areas:

### B. Add potential blog post topics / ideas to your personal branding guide (part VII)

::: {.callout-important}
## TODO come back to this
:::

<!-- - have a list of blog post topics ahead of time -- why would someone come to your website and what can you provide them? no one is just going to come to your website -- when no one does, they discover why they should come back; see resource / interesteing story; build a pattern of trust with your website and brand -->
<!-- - what would be somehting that would bring someone to my page; be strategic; give options for ideas -->
<!-- - highlighting how a function works; advice that you wish you had before (don't be prescriptive, but give them ideas) -->
<!-- - have them read 2 posts in class and highlight what they do or don't like about them in class; can think about tone, framing, humor, illustrations/visuals (what did they add/subtract); writing is subjective! -->

<!-- - have a draft outline of a blog post; by end of course, there should a fully finished blog; can amplify on social media -->

<!-- - storytelling -- core pieces + embellishments (e.g. humor;j should add some but don't have to add all of them) -->

<!-- - rescue was usign a super frustrating fxn but then found a new bettter one! -->

<!-- - can break the rules; should have a story but not all of it has to be a part of the story necessarily -->

<!-- - read some curated SECTIONS of blog posts and discuss things like tone, audience, humor, visuals (things they liked/didnt like as both a reader and a writer -->
<!-- - draft an outline of their blog post in class and maybe exchange with someone for thoughts -->

1. [**Continue drafting, writing, and polishing your blog post.**]{.teal-text} You (most likely) won't have a fully-written blog post by the end of class today, but **you should plan to complete and publish your post by the end of this class.**
2. [**Seek feedback from others.**]{.teal-text} Consider switching blog posts with one (or more) of your peers, or stick around for office hours to chat with me about your ideas!
