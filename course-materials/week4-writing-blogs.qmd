By the end of today's class, you should have:

- a draft of your first data science blog post!

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-class Prep {#pre-class-prep}

Please be sure to complete the following before class:

### A. Check out some data science-y blog posts

Reading other data science blogs is the best way to get a sense of not only the breadth of topics folks in the community are writing about, but also the tone, writing styles, and creative approaches you might take as a blogger. Check out a couple posts before class!
